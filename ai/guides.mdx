## Overview

Interactive guides are step-by-step walkthroughs that help users navigate your application. Each guide consists of a series of steps that can include instructions, element highlighting, and automated actions.

<Info>
  All guides are automatically generated by AI ‚Äî you don't need to configure anything manually. The technical details below explain how guides work under the hood, helping you understand the system's capabilities.

## Guide structure

A guide is defined by the following properties:

```typescript
interface Guide {
  id: string;          // Unique identifier for the guide
  name: string;        // Display name of the guide
  steps: Step[];       // Array of steps in the guide
  resumeData?: {       // Optional data for resuming guides
    currentStep: number;
    steps: Step[];
  };
}
```

## Guide triggers

Users can trigger guides by simply asking questions in the chat widget. The AI determines whether to provide a quick answer or create a visual guide. For example:&#x20;

* "How do I create a new project?"

* "Can you show me how to update my profile picture?"

* "I need help setting up my account"

Simple questions get instant answers through AI chat, while complex tasks trigger step-by-step guides. Learn more about [AI chat](https://docs.pointer.so/features/chat).

## Step configuration

Each step in a guide contains:

```typescript
interface Step {
  id: string;          // Unique identifier for the step
  position: string;    // Position of the highlight/pointer
  instructions: string; // Text instructions for the user
  action?: Action;     // Optional action to perform
  page: string;        // Page/route where the step occurs
}
```

## Supported element interactions

## User controls and feedback

Users are able to pause/resume guides, skip steps, and exit guides at any time.

When a guide is completed, users can rate their experience by clicking üëç or üëé, add comments about what worked or didn't, and report any issues they encountered.

## Troubleshooting

In testing, we've noticed a few common issues that can occur during guide generation and execution:

* Elements not found

* Failed interactions

* Navigation problems

* Timing issues
