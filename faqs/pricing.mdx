  <Accordion title="How do I know what plan is right for me?" defaultOpen={false}>
    Calculate your monthly needs based on your current support volume. Number of support tickets per month * 10 = number of credits youâ€™ll need.
    
    Consider Enterprise if you need unlimited views, advanced security features, or have a large team requiring custom permissions and roles. If you're interested in the Enterprise plan, [contact us](mailto:team@pointer.so).

<Accordion title="Is pricing based on users or projects?" defaultOpen={false}>
  Billing is project-dependent, not user-dependent. Every project you have will
  be billed separately, allowing flexibility for teams with multiple products or
  applications. To change your plan, navigate to the [Billing tab
  ](https://app.pointer.so/settings?tab=billing)of our Settings page.&#x20;
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="How do upgrades and downgrades work?" defaultOpen={false}>
  Upgrades and downgrades take effect at the end of your current monthly billing
  period. You can adjust your plan as your needs change. To change your plan,
  navigate to the [Billing tab ](https://app.pointer.so/settings?tab=billing)of
  our Settings page.&#x20;

<Accordion title="What happens if I need more credits?" defaultOpen={false}>
  We charge overages at 2-3x the base rate per request. You can purchase
  additional credits last minute to continue using Pointer without interruption.

<Accordion title="Do you offer a free tier?" defaultOpen={false}>
  While we don't offer a free tier, we do offer a 7-day free trial for all new users.

  <Accordion title="Is it possible to remove the Pointer branding?" defaultOpen={false}>
    The terms of all of our plans ask that users keep the Pointer branding in the widget (see [our terms](https://pointer.so/terms) for more details). If you need to white label Pointer, it can be offered as an add-on to enterprise plans.
