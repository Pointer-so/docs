  <Accordion title="How do I know what plan is right for me?" defaultOpen={false}>
    Calculate your monthly needs: Users × Help requests.&#x20;

    For example, if you have 10,000 users and 5% need help twice per month, that's 1,000 monthly requests (10,000 × 0.05 × 2). The Pro plan at $50/month would be perfect as it covers up to 2,500 requests.&#x20;

    Consider Enterprise if you need unlimited requests, advanced security features, or have a large team requiring custom permissions and roles. If you're interested in the Enterprise plan, [contact us](mailto:team@pointer.so).&#x20;

  <Accordion title="Is pricing based on users or projects?" defaultOpen={false}>
    Billing is project-dependent, not user-dependent. Every project you have will be billed separately, allowing flexibility for teams with multiple products or applications. To change your plan, navigate to the [Billing tab ](https://app.pointer.so/settings?tab=billing)of our Settings page.&#x20;
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do upgrades and downgrades work?" defaultOpen={false}>
    Upgrades and downgrades take effect at the end of your current monthly billing period. You can adjust your plan as your needs change. To change your plan, navigate to the [Billing tab ](https://app.pointer.so/settings?tab=billing)of our Settings page.&#x20;
