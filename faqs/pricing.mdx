  <Accordion title="How do I know what plan is right for me?" defaultOpen={false}>
    Calculate your monthly needs based on your current support volume. 
    
    For example, if you have 20,000 users and typically get 250 support tickets per month, expect about 500 guide with Pointer since users are more likely to seek help when it's visual and immediate (250 Ã— 2). The Pro plan at $50/month would be perfect as it covers up to 1,000 credits (roughly 500 guides). 
    
    Consider Enterprise if you need unlimited views, advanced security features, or have a large team requiring custom permissions and roles. If you're interested in the Enterprise plan, [contact us](mailto:team@pointer.so).

<Accordion title="Is pricing based on users or projects?" defaultOpen={false}>
  Billing is project-dependent, not user-dependent. Every project you have will
  be billed separately, allowing flexibility for teams with multiple products or
  applications. To change your plan, navigate to the [Billing tab
  ](https://app.pointer.so/settings?tab=billing)of our Settings page.&#x20;

<Accordion title="How do upgrades and downgrades work?" defaultOpen={false}>
  Upgrades and downgrades take effect at the end of your current monthly billing
  period. You can adjust your plan as your needs change. To change your plan,
  navigate to the [Billing tab ](https://app.pointer.so/settings?tab=billing)of
  our Settings page.&#x20;

  <Accordion title="Is it possible to remove the Pointer branding?" defaultOpen={false}>
    The terms of all of our plans ask that users keep the Pointer branding in the widget (see [our terms](https://pointer.so/terms) for more details). If you need to white label Pointer, it can be offered as an add-on to enterprise plans.
