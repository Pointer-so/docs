## Overview

Pointer uses a credit-based system to manage and track usage across different features and operations.

Credits are the primary currency for using Pointer's features, ensuring fair and transparent usage tracking.

<Note>
  Oftentimes, 1 chat message is equivalent to 1 credit, and 1 guide is
  equivalent to 4 credits. This is a strong estimate based on testing, but the
  actual cost may vary depending on certain factors (e.g., conversation length,
  knowledge base size, etc.).
</Note>

## Credit costs

**1 chat message is equivalent to 1 credit.** This is usually for simple question-answer interactions. For example, a question like "What's the purpose of this function?" would typically be 1 credit.

**1 guide is equivalent to 4 credits.** This is for more complex questions that require a more detailed explanation. Most guides are usually 4-5 steps, which would typically cost 4 credits. For more complex guides, cost may be higher.

A typical 4-credit guide might look like this:

- User: "How do I create a new project?"
- Guide steps:
  - Step 1: "Navigate to the 'Projects' page in the dashboard."
  - Step 2: "Click on the 'New Project' button."
  - Step 3: "Enter the project name."
  - Step 4: "Enter the project description."
  - Step 5: "Click on the 'Create' button."

## Emergency credits and overages

If you're running low on credits or need additional capacity, we offer immediate credit purchases. Typically, we charge 2-3x the normal rate for overages.

## Additional notes

For all plans, credits reset at the beginning of your billing cycle. However, credits that are purchased separately do not reset.

All credit purchases are processed securely through Stripe. View our [billing page](https://app.pointer.so/settings?tab=billing) for more details.
