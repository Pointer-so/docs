## Overview&#x20;

Add web pages to your knowledge base by submitting their URLs. Pointer automatically extracts content, making it available for the AI when answering questions. You can add web content to your knowledge base on the [Knowledge](https://app.pointer.so/knowledge) page of our dashboard.

## How it works&#x20;

When you submit a URL:&#x20;

* Content is automatically extracted and processed&#x20;

* Text is formatted for readability&#x20;

* Duplicates are prevented&#x20;

* Content becomes searchable by Pointer

## Rescraping content

Content from URLs can change over time. You can trigger manual rescrapes if content changes sooner, with a 5-minute cooldown between rescrapes.&#x20;

## Page discovery

Currently, when you add a URL like `pointer.so`, we only process that specific page. You'll need to manually add important subpages like `pointer.so/pricing` or `pointer.so/about`.

<Note>
  We're building automated page discovery that will find and process subpages automatically. Soon you won't need to add pages individually.
</Note>

## Best practices

Submit URLs that are publicly accessible and contain substantial text content. Wait for processing to complete between submissions and check if similar content already exists. For large sites, consider which pages contain the most relevant content.

## Troubleshooting

If content extraction fails, check that the URL is accessible and under 10MB. Some sites block automated access or require authentication. Dynamic content and certain formats may not extract cleanly.
