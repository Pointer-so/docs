## Overview

Uploading files to your knowledge base gives Pointer more context about your product. Support articles, API docs, landing pages, and other resources help the AI provide more accurate and detailed responses. You can add files to your knowledge base on the [Knowledge](https://app.pointer.so/knowledge) page of our dashboard.

## Supported file types

* **Text and code**

  * Programming files (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, Ruby, PHP)

  * Markup (HTML, CSS, Markdown)

  * Configuration (JSON, Shell scripts)

* **Plain text files**

  * Documents

  * PDF files

  * Word documents (.doc, .docx)

  * CSV files

## How it works

Each uploaded file goes through validation to check its type and size. For documents, we extract the text while preserving important formatting. Files are stored securely and immediately become available to the AI for answering user questions.

## Best practices

### Organization

* Using descriptive names ("onboarding-guide.pdf" vs "doc1.pdf")

* Adding files in logical groups (all API docs together, etc.)

* Removing outdated versions

### File types

* Upload source files when possible (Markdown over PDFs)

* Keep formatting simple for better text extraction

### Performance

* Keep files under 10MB for fastest processing

* Wait for processing to complete between uploads

* Test AI responses after adding new content

* Remove files no longer needed

<Tip>
  Focus on quality over quantity. A smaller set of well-organized, current files works better than a large collection of scattered content.

## Troubleshooting

Upload issues usually stem from unsupported formats or size limits. Network problems can occasionally interrupt uploads. Always verify your files appear in the dashboard before removing the originals.

## Current limitations

PowerPoint parsing is coming soon, and some specialized formats aren't yet supported. While we preserve most formatting, some complex layouts may be simplified. Check your plan for specific file size limits. [Contact us](https://dub.sh/pointer-community) if you need support for a specific file type.
