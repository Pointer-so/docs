## Overview

QA patterns are automatically generated patterns of questions and answers that appear frequently in user interactions within your project. They provide insights into common user inquiries. You can view these analytics on the [Home](https://app.pointer.so) page of our dashboard.

## Structure

Each QA pattern contains the following fields:

* `question`: the canonical form of the question

* `answer`: the best answer to the question

* `frequency`: number of times this Q\&A pair has been encountered

* `confidence`: a score between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating pattern reliability

## Data collection

* QA patterns are automatically collected and analyzed from user interactions

* The system processes patterns through:

* Analysis of conversations based on specified time ranges (7, 30, or 90 days)

* Automatic pattern matching and frequency tracking

* Confidence scoring based on consistency of answers
