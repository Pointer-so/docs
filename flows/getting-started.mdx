## Overview

Interactive flows help users discover and learn your product through step-by-step guidance. Unlike our AI chat and interactive guides, flows require explicit configuration from developers, giving you precise control over the user experience.

With Pointer's flows, you can:

- Onboard new users with guided tours of your product
- Highlight new features or important functionality
- Guide users through complex workflows
- Increase feature adoption and user engagement
- Reduce support tickets by proactively educating users

Flows are fully customizable and can be triggered automatically (when a user visits a specific page or meets certain conditions) or manually (when a user clicks a button).

We're giving flows their own section because they require additional configuration and are designed for specific scenarios\\\\!

<Note>
  Note: We're working on a visual editor and browser extension to make flow creation even easier. For now, flows are configured through code, giving you more flexibility.

## Getting started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Grab an API key from the Pointer dashboard.">
    Login to the [Pointer dashboard](https://app.pointer.so), then create a project. Two keys will be automatically generated for you — a production and development key. Copy the development key and store it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the Pointer SDK using your preferred package manager.">
    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash npm
    npm install pointer-sdk
    ```

    
    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm add pointer-sdk
    ```

    
    ```bash yarn
    yarn add pointer-sdk
    ```

    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your environment variables.">
    Add the appropriate Pointer API key into your `.env` file.

    ```bash
    POINTER_API_KEY=pt_dev_*********************
    ```

    <Note>
      Note that there are two types of API keys: development and production.

      - **Development keys** (`pt_dev_*`):
        - For local development only
        - No origin restrictions
        - Stricter rate limits
      - **Production keys** (`pt_live_*`):
        - Required for deployed applications
        - Must specify allowed origin domains
        - Domains must be valid (e.g., example.com)
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the provider">
    Add the `PointerFlowProvider` to wrap your app, typically in a layout file that contains your authenticated routes:

    ```typescript
    import { PointerFlowProvider } from "pointer-sdk";
    
    function App() {
    	return (
    		<PointerFlowProvider
      		 apiKey={process.env.POINTER_API_KEY!}
             flows={myFlows}
            >
      		  {children}
    		</PointerFlowProvider>
    	);
    }
    ```

    See more info below on configuring the `PointerFlowProvider`.
  </Step>
</Steps>
