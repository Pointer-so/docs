## Overview

Pointer's interactive onboarding workflows allow you to guide your users through your app with customizable step-by-step tours. Using our onboarding componentsâ€”built with React and integrated via a Context providerâ€”you can create multi-step guides, validate user actions, and provide an engaging introduction to your application.

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Grab an API key from the Pointer dashboard.">
    Login to the [Pointer dashboard](https://app.pointer.so), then create a project. Two keys will be automatically generated for you â€” a production and development key. Copy the development key and store it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the Pointer SDK using your preferred package manager.">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash npm
      npm install pointer-sdk
      ```

      ```bash pnpm
      pnpm add pointer-sdk
      ```

      ```bash yarn
      yarn add pointer-sdk
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your environment variables.">
    Add the appropriate Pointer API key into your `.env` file.

    ```bash
    POINTER_API_KEY=pt_dev_*********************
    ```

    <Note>
      Note that there are two types of API keys: development and production.
      - **Development keys** (`pt_dev_*`):
        - For local development only
        - No origin restrictions
        - Stricter rate limits
      
      - **Production keys** (`pt_live_*`):
        - Required for deployed applications
        - Must specify allowed origin domains
        - Domains must be valid (e.g., example.com)
      
      API keys are only shown in full during creation. After that, only the last 4 characters will be visible.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wrap your app with the PointerOnboardingProvider.">
    In your root file, (e.g., `layout.tsx`, `index.tsx`, `_app.tsx`) wrap your app with the `PointerOnboardingProvider`.

    ```typescript
    import { PointerOnboardingProvider } from 'pointer-sdk';

    function App() {
      return (
          <PointerOnboardingProvider 
            apiKey={process.env.POINTER_API_KEY!}
            config={onboardingConfig} // This is the onboarding guide object
          >
            {children}
          </PointerOnboardingProvider>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create an onboarding flow

The onboarding flow consists of a configuration object that defines both the welcome experience and a series of guides. Each guide can be one of two types:
- A step-by-step walkthrough guide
- A simple button-link guide that redirects users to external resources

```typescript
const onboardingConfig: OnboardingConfig = {
  id: 'getting-started',
  welcomeHeading: 'Hi there ðŸ‘‹',
  welcomeSubheading: 'Welcome to Pointer.',
  welcomeDescription: "Let's get you familiar with the core features of our platform.",
  welcomeImage: 'your-welcome-image-url', // Optional
  guides: [
    // Example of a step-by-step walkthrough guide
    {
      id: 'create-project',
      title: 'Create your first project',
      description: 'Start by creating a new project to organize your work.',
      buttonText: 'Create project',
      page: '/', // The page where this guide should be activated
      steps: [
        {
          position: 'project-name-input',
          instructions: 'Enter a name for your project.',
          action: { type: 'input' as const }
        },
        {
          position: 'create-project-button',
          instructions: 'Click to create your project.',
          action: { type: 'click' as const }
        }
      ]
    },
    // Example of a button-link guide (no steps, just external link)
    {
      id: 'view-docs',
      title: 'Check out our docs',
      description: 'For more information on how to use our platform, check out our documentation.',
      buttonText: 'View docs',
      buttonLink: 'https://docs.example.com',
      steps: [] // Empty array for button-link guides
    }
  ]
};
```

## Guide types

1. Step-by-step walkthrough guide

Used for interactive tutorials within your application:

```typescript
interface WorkflowGuide {
  id: string; // A unique identifier for the guide
  title: string; // The title of the guide
  description: string; // A short description of the guide
  buttonText: string; // The text of the button that activates the guide
  page?: string;        // The page where this guide should be activated (optional)
  steps?: OnboardingStep[]; // An array of steps that make up the guide
}
```

The `OnboardingStep` interface is defined as follows:

```typescript
export interface OnboardingStep {
  position: string; // ID of element to be highlighted (see instructions below)
  instructions: string; // The instructions to be displayed to the user
  action?: Action; // The action to be performed when the step is completed (can be `click`, `input`, `select`, `scroll`, `navigate`, etc.)
}
```

2. Button-link guide

Used for redirecting users toexternal resources or links (docs, community, etc.):

```typescript
interface WorkflowGuide {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  buttonText: string;
  buttonLink: string;   // External URL to open when clicked
  // No steps are required for button-link guides
}
```


## Element identification

For the onboarding system to work, each element you want to highlight in your steps must have a specific ID attribute in your HTML/JSX. This is crucial for the system to locate and highlight the correct elements.

<Note>
  We have you manually ID elements because it allows you to have complete control over the onboarding experience.
</Note>

```typescript
// In your onboarding config
{
  steps: [
    {
      position: 'profile-name-input', // This must match an element's ID
      instructions: 'Enter your full name',
      action: { type: 'input' as const }
    }
  ]
}

// In your React component
function ProfileForm() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* The id attribute must match the position value in your step */}
      <input 
        id="profile-name-input"
        type="text" 
        placeholder="Enter your name"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

<Tip>
  Best practices for element identification:
  - Use unique IDs for each element
  - Keep IDs concise and descriptive
  - Use IDs that match the step position
</Tip>

## State management

The onboarding system automatically manages:
- Guide completion status
- Current step within each guide
- Cross-page navigation state
- Button-link guide states (for returning users)

State is persisted in localStorage using three keys:

```typescript
const WORKFLOW_STORAGE_KEY = 'pointer-workflow-{id}';      // Guide progress
const STATE_STORAGE_KEY = 'pointer-onboarding-state-{id}'; // Overall state
const BUTTON_LINK_STATE_KEY = 'pointer-button-link-state-{id}'; // External link state
```

## Styling

You have complete control over the styling of the onboarding flow. For more information, see the [Styling](https://docs.pointer.so/features/styling) section.
