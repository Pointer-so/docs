## Overview

Pointer's interactive onboarding workflows allow you to guide your users through your app with customizable step-by-step tours. Using our onboarding componentsâ€”built with React and integrated via a Context providerâ€”you can create multi-step guides, validate user actions, and provide an engaging introduction to your application.

## Getting started

### 1. Installation and setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Grab an API key from the Pointer dashboard.">
    Login to the [Pointer dashboard](https://app.pointer.so), then create a project. Two keys will be automatically generated for you â€” a production and development key. Copy the development key and store it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the Pointer SDK using your preferred package manager.">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash npm
      npm install pointer-sdk
      ```

      ```bash pnpm
      pnpm add pointer-sdk
      ```

      ```bash yarn
      yarn add pointer-sdk
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your environment variables.">
    Add the appropriate Pointer API key into your `.env` file.

    ```bash
    POINTER_API_KEY=pt_dev_*********************
    ```

    <Note>
      Note that there are two types of API keys: development and production.
      - **Development keys** (`pt_dev_*`):
        - For local development only
        - No origin restrictions
        - Stricter rate limits
      
      - **Production keys** (`pt_live_*`):
        - Required for deployed applications
        - Must specify allowed origin domains
        - Domains must be valid (e.g., example.com)
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Configure the provider

Add the `PointerOnboardingProvider` to wrap your app, typically in a layout file that contains your authenticated routes:

```typescript
import { PointerOnboardingProvider } from 'pointer-sdk';

function App() {
  return (
    <PointerOnboardingProvider 
      apiKey={process.env.POINTER_API_KEY!}
      config={onboardingConfig}
      //Styling options, see below
    >
      {children}
    </PointerOnboardingProvider>
  );
}
```

### 3. Define your onboarding flow

Create an onboarding configuration object that defines your welcome screen and guides:

```typescript
const onboardingConfig: OnboardingConfig = {
  id: 'getting-started',
  welcomeHeading: 'Hi there ðŸ‘‹',
  welcomeSubheading: 'Welcome to Pointer.',
  welcomeDescription: "Let's get you familiar with the core features.",
  welcomeImage: 'your-welcome-image-url', // Optional
  guides: [
    {
      id: 'create-project',
      title: 'Create your first project',
      description: 'Start by creating a new project.',
      buttonText: 'Create project',
      page: '/', // The page where this guide activates
      steps: [
        {
          position: 'project-name-input',
          instructions: 'Enter a name for your project.',
          action: { type: 'input' as const }
        },
        {
          position: 'create-project-button',
          instructions: 'Click to create your project.',
          action: { type: 'click' as const }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
};
```

### 4. Prepare your components

Add IDs to the elements you want to highlight in your onboarding steps:

```typescript
function ProjectForm() {
  return (
    <form>
      {/* Add IDs that match your step positions */}
      <input 
        id="project-name-input"
        type="text" 
        placeholder="Project name"
      />
      <button id="create-project-button">
        Create Project
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

<Note>
  Best practices for element identification:
  - Use unique IDs that match your step positions exactly
  - Keep IDs concise and descriptive
  - Verify IDs exist on the correct pages
</Note>

## Customization options

### Styling

You can customize the appearance of your onboarding flow through these props:

```typescript
<PointerOnboardingProvider
  // Appearance
  primaryColor="#007AFF" // Main color for buttons and interactive elements
  secondaryColor="#F5F5F5" // Secondary color for backgrounds
  tertiaryColor="#333333" // Color used for text elements
  accentColor="#FFD700" // Highlight and emphasis color
  backgroundColor="#FFFFFF" // Background color of the modal/widget
  borderColor="#E5E5E5" // Color used for borders
  borderRadius="8px" // Border radius for rounded corners
  
  // Branding
  logomark="/path-to-your-logo.svg" // Your company logo
  widgetHeader="Getting started ðŸ‘‹" // Custom header text
>
  {children}
</PointerOnboardingProvider>
```

### Guide types

You can create two types of guides:

1. **Step-by-step walkthrough guide**:
```typescript
interface WorkflowGuide {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  buttonText: string;
  page?: string;        // The page where this guide activates
  steps: OnboardingStep[];
}
```

2. **Button-link guide** (for external resources):
```typescript
interface WorkflowGuide {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  buttonText: string;
  buttonLink: string;   // External URL to open
}
```

## State management

The onboarding system automatically manages:
- Guide completion status
- Current step within each guide
- Cross-page navigation state
- Button-link guide states

State is persisted in localStorage using these keys:
```typescript
const WORKFLOW_STORAGE_KEY = 'pointer-workflow-{id}';      // Guide progress
const STATE_STORAGE_KEY = 'pointer-onboarding-state-{id}'; // Overall state
const BUTTON_LINK_STATE_KEY = 'pointer-button-link-state-{id}'; // External link state
```

<Note>
  **Testing & Development**
  
  To re-trigger the onboarding flow during testing or development, clear the related localStorage keys:
  ```javascript
  // Replace {id} with your onboarding config ID
  localStorage.removeItem('pointer-workflow-{id}');
  localStorage.removeItem('pointer-onboarding-state-{id}');
  localStorage.removeItem('pointer-button-link-state-{id}');
  ```
  You can also simply go to Chrome DevTools, navigate to the Application tab, and clear the localStorage keys. After clearing these keys, refresh the page to restart the onboarding flow.

  We are currently working on a "Dev mode" that will allow you to re-trigger the onboarding flow without clearing the localStorage keys.
</Note>
