## How it works

Our AI chat agent automatically understands your app by analyzing UI elements, their relationships, and semantic meaning. As soon as you install Pointer, it can answer basic questions about your interface and features.

For more accurate and detailed responses, [connect your knowledge base](https://docs.pointer.so/knowledge/integrations). This gives the AI deeper context about your product's concepts, workflows, and best practices. The AI combines this knowledge with its UI understanding to provide comprehensive assistance.

When users ask questions, the AI determines whether to give a quick answer or generate an interactive guide based on the complexity of the task. Simple queries like "What is a project?" get immediate answers, while step-by-step requests like "How do I set up my team?" trigger visual guides.
