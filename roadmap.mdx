If there's a feature you'd like us to create, we'd love to hear from you — we’ll make sure to prioritize it! To request a feature, either [join our Discord community](https://dub.sh/pointer-community) (preferred) or [email us](mailto:team@pointer.so).

| Feature           | Status      |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| Customizations    | Done        |
| Analytics         | Finalizing  |
| Teams             | Finalizing  |
| Multi-page guides | In progress |
| Live chat         | Not started |
| Integrations      | Not started |

## Limitations

While we're working on these features, there are also some known limitations:

- Only single-page guides are supported
- Guides are unreliable with dynamic elements (e.g., dialogs and popovers)
- Works with only React-based apps (if you're using a different framework, [please let us know](mailto:team@pointer.so) and we'll prioritize it)

These are all high priority items for us, and we're working on them as quickly as possible.
