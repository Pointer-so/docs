If there's a feature you'd like us to create, we'd love to hear from you — we’ll make sure to prioritize it! To request a feature, either [join our Discord community](https://dub.sh/pointer-community) (preferred) or [email us](mailto:team@pointer.so).

| Feature                   | Status      |
| ------------------------- | ----------- |
| Onboarding workflows      | Done        |
| Custom guides             | In progress |
| Multi-page guides         | In progress |
| Co-browsing               | Not started |
| Ticket resolution         | Not started |
| Slack/Discord integration | Not started |
| Product insights          | Not started |

## Limitations

While we're working on these features, there are also some known limitations:

- Only single-page guides are supported
- Guides are unreliable with dynamic elements (e.g., dialogs and popovers)
- Works with only React-based apps (if you're using a different framework, [please let us know](mailto:team@pointer.so) and we'll prioritize it)

These are all high priority items for us, and we're working on them as quickly as possible.
